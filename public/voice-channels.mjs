// Which players hear each other, shared by the client and the server.
//
// A channel is the room a player is in. Two players are voice peers only when
// they are in the same channel and that channel's rule puts them together. Both
// rules are symmetric -- distance is, and so is sharing a team -- so one
// predicate answers for both ends of a connection.
//
// It has to be the server that applies it. The media is peer to peer, so a
// client-side filter is not a filter at all: a modified client that opened a
// connection anyway would simply be heard. What the server withholds is the
// roster and the signalling, which is what makes the rule stick.
//
// Rogue and Observer are teams here. That is what upstream does -- the team
// message dispatch in src/bzfs/bzfs.cxx sends to every player whose
// `isTeam(_team)` matches, with no exception for either.
