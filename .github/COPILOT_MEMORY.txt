Player join/entry/scoreboard flow:
- On connect, server adds player to player list, includes them in `init` and broadcasts `playerJoined` with health=0 and position (0,0,0).
- Client adds all players in `init`/`playerJoined` to scoreboard and world, but sets tank.visible = false if health=0.
- When player sends `joinGame`, server updates player and broadcasts `playerJoined` with health>0 and spawn position.
- Client sets tank.visible = true and updates position on `playerJoined` with health>0.
- If player leaves before joining, server sends `playerLeft` and client removes them from scoreboard and world.
- This ensures scoreboard always shows all connected players, tanks are only visible if joined, and state is always consistent.
